This API provides a list of users and their associated information, such as their WhatsApp number and session ID. It was built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. You can access this API to retrieve user information in a structured JSON format.

## Features

- **Generate 100 users**: Each user has a `username`, `wa_number` (WhatsApp number), and `session_id`.
- **Return JSON data**: When you access the root endpoint (`/`), you will get a nicely formatted JSON response with user details.
- **Easy to set up**: The API can be run locally or deployed on a server with minimal setup.
